THIS PPROJECT WAS DEVELOPED AS MY UNIVERISTY COURSEWORK, FULL REPORT ON HOW USER CENTERED DESIGN APPROACH WAS FOLLOWED IS DETAILED IN REPORT.

Backend: PHP
Frontend: HTML, CSS, bootstrap

This is an initial prototype TIME BANKING WEBSITE where users will be from a certain community/town and they would be doing work for each other but instead of money,
they will be getting paid in time (hours) which they can use as a currency to get their own work done. This concept was formulated when the outbreak of covid was
very intense and it was developed to be used incase there was need of a system which involves no traditional currency and also keeps a community self-sufficient and bound 
to each other with minimal external contact.    


Steps you have to follow in order to run the PHP website: 
1 - Import/Load/Run the database "mdb_az5645a.sql" into your phpmyadmin.
2 - Put project files into specified folder. If you are using XAMP then put your project folder in 'C:\xampp\htdocs\'.
3 - If you are using XAMPP then you also need to change the connection variables in 'server.php'. There will be a comment line there to help you.
4 - Run your PHP server in browser and open the specified folder, ENJOY THE TEMPLATE. It can be amended for many purposes.  

NOTE: I had named worker database table as “freelancer” to make things clear for myself in the beginning of development phase. 
It’s just the word used for “worker” in my database.
